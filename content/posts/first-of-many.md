I've heard recently that a good way to learn is to write, that writing forces you to think and organize your thoughts and to create new connections while contemplating what to write next.

It may have been the prevalence of screens in my last few years that convinced me that I could learn solely through passive consumption. Watching a video can be a good intro to a subject, but it's no substitute for the slow and thoughtful act of writing and thinking.

So, this is the first post of many (hopefully). I hope to learn more, and have this medium help me not only catalog what I know, but help me to learn by doing.
